# Seq2Scratch

This repo contains "from scratch" or "only NumPy" implementations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs) with well-known activations and metrics. Example notebook is added for quide. Sample task: " Human Activity Classification from Movements Signals". 
## This repo contains:

    * Multi-class Time Series Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks
    * Multi-layer RNN (from 1 to 5 layer)
    * Convex Optimizers  
      * Adam Optimizer
      * AdaGrad Optimizer
      * RMSprop Optimizer
      * SGD Optimizer
      * SGD with Momentum Optimizer
    * Vecorized & Fast Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) for all layers
    * Gradient Clipping & Early Stopping
    * Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with different layer sizes & parameters
