# Seq2Scratch

## What the heck is this project?
The goal is to built my own Deep Learning framework for sequence & time-series models using only fundamental programming techniques. It includes all kind of loss functions, optimization methods, pre-processing functions, hyper-parameter search algorithms, different parameter initilizations, activation functions, data augmentations, regularizations, statistical analysis and fundamental layers with its pre-computed, fast and efficient gradients (from dense layers to rnn layers, embedding layers to RNN architectures (LSTM, GRU) and much more). This is a end-to-end, fully-scratch and generic Deep Learning framework for mainly time-series and textual data. 

## What's included?
This repo contains "from scratch" or "only NumPy" implementations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs) with well-known activations and metrics. Example notebook is added for quide. Sample task: " Human Activity Classification from Movements Signals". 

## This repo contains:

    * Multi-class Time Series Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks
    * Multi-layer RNN (from 1 to 5 layer)
    * Non-Convex Optimizers  
      * Adam Optimizer
      * AdaGrad Optimizer
      * RMSprop Optimizer
      * SGD Optimizer
      * SGD with Momentum Optimizer
    * Vecorized & Fast Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) for all layers
    * Gradient Clipping & Early Stopping
    * Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with different layer sizes & parameters
